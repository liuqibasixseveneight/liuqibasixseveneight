## ðŸ”­ About me
I'm a Front-End Developer working primarily in React JS. I'm currently working on a `social-network-template` built in a MERNG (MongoDB, Express, React, Node, GraphQL) stack which can be found [here](https://github.com/liuqibasixseveneight/social-network-template)

## ðŸŒ± Currently learning
I'm forever learning, but my primary focus at the moment is getting better at:
  - The MERNG stack (hence the `social-network-template` project [found here](https://github.com/liuqibasixseveneight/social-network-template)!)
  - Backend development
  - Designing UX/UI and prototyping (mostly using Figma for now)

## ðŸ¤” Can you help me?
I'm always looking to improve, and I welcome any criticism or suggestions you might have! Please feel free to comment on my code, my approach or anything else if you think it'd be constructive!

## ðŸ‘¯ Let's collaborate!
Do you have a project that you think I can help with? Open-source or private, paid or not, I'm open to helping where I can be useful and/or where I can learn! Please get in touch if you think I have something to offer!

## ðŸ’¬ Want to chat?
Do you need help, have some constructive criticism or would just like to talk about all things software development? Please get in touch!

## âš¡ Fun fact
I love all things mechanical keyboards! If you're rocking a custom keeb, please share your setup with me!
